- Layers of itcss:

1 - Vendor -â€Šfiles for third party code. At the top to be the most easily overridden
2 - Settingsâ€Šâ€”â€Špreprocessors, fonts, variables (doesnâ€™t generate any style output)
3 - Toolsâ€Šâ€”â€Šmixins, functions (doesnâ€™t generate any style output)

4 - Genericâ€Šâ€”â€Šresets or normalizing files
  - Objects â€“ Classes for page structure typically following the OOCSS methodology
5 - Elementsâ€Šâ€”â€Šbare HTML elements (H1, a, p, etcâ€¦) {Generic could be here!}

6 - Componentsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠMajority of code goes here to style specific UI components
7 - Utilities/Helpers/Trumpsâ€Šâ€”â€Šutilities and helper classes that have the most authority (show/hide, color helpers, etcâ€¦)

Note: these categories can be used as folder, thus using many css files with close logic within em all

Components will be named with at least two words, with a dash between each word.(.like-button, .like-button, .article-card)
- so it can get very simple to understain
- Mine current naming convention is to name a class with only one word, thus making it interact with the tag and others classes and create meaning fom it : section.main, input.search, p.center
- might two words make my code more logical? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

.like-button {
  &.-wide { /* ... */ }
  &.-short { /* ... */ }
  &.-disabled { /* ... */ }
}

Elements are things inside your component.
Each component may have elements. They should have classes that are only one word.

They said is ok to use margin and stuff inside components but not on the component itself
so you could set a margin of a component inside a component. but not on the default one

they say to use a file for component and import it by using wildcards(components/*)

they say to avoid two level nesting w/ the preprocessor. if you wanna go deeper write it yourself

/* âœ“ Better: 2 levels */
.image-frame {
  > .description { /* ... */ }
  > .description > .icon { /* ... */ }
}

they say child selector is safer
